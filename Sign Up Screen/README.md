This is a simple Flutter Sign Up screen created as a beginner project.
It includes basic input fields (TextField) for username, email, and password, along with two buttons (ElevatedButton) for sign up and sign in with Google.
The design uses a clean blue background with white elements for a neat look.
No backend, just simple UI for learning and practicing Flutter widgets.
